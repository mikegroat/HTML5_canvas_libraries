# HTML5_canvas_libraries

This repo contains general libraries I have created.  The idea that each library provides building blocks on which I can layer to create new stuff.

The library contains the following files:
1. color.js - a simple color palette holder and chooser.
2. index.html - a general html file that includes scripts to all the library files.
3. particle.js - a class file for particles.
4. vector.js - a vector library.
5. sparks.js - a library to make sparks.
